# Automatic instalation
 1. Download the [stikosekutilities installer](https://github.com/Dev-Packet/stikosekutilities2-installer/releases/download/1.0.0.0/stikosekutilities2_Installer.exe)
 2. Run the installer. If windows shows that its a "dangerous file" click More > Run anyway. (its safe and open source)
 3. The installer will open up. You can navigate it with arrows.
 4. Select stikosekutilities - (old but gold) if its not selected by default and press enter.
 5. Select install.
 The installer will now do all the work and once it says instalation complete you are ready to go.
 If the instalator fails, try the manual instalation instead.
 
# Manual Installation
 NOTE: Please only use this method if the installer fails.
 1. Download [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21),the file name should start with "BepInEx_x64".
 2. Download [stikosekutilities.dll](https://github.com/stikosek/stikosekutilities/releases/download/download/stikosekutilitites.dll)
 3. Extract the Zip archive (BepInEx file) in your Muck Installation Folder(open Steam then Right Click Muck in your library -> Manage -> Browse local Files).
 4. Start the Game and then close it once you are in the Main Menu (We do this beucase we need bepinex to generate some files).
 5. Go to the "plugins" in "Muck/BepInEx/" (Will load after step 4) then copy the [stikosekutilities.dll](https://github.com/stikosek/stikosekutilities/releases/latest/download/stikosekutilities2.dll) into it.
 6. And your done! Launch the game and your all set. If you have trouble with this feel free to ask for support on my discord server!
